Convert base 10 to D'ni base 25 number system

This project that CorpNewt and I have put together.

This is used to input most large base 10 numbers and convert them to base 25. It then converts them to the D'ni number system and outputs a
png of the output in D'ni Writting

This reqires Python 3.x and Pillow
